TM,5319,10/20,11:57,12:37,White,Female,576,,"Thinks its interesting, just to see- especially since I took micro-econ, and tlaked about nothing is free. Seeing this research it really emphasizes that even though this site is free, they're taking this data from me and to keep me on it, and tailor sponsored content to me, this study shows how successful is at how facebook can feel out and compliment what a user is looking for, and coerce them to stay on their site longer."

TM,3406,10/20,1:03,1:36,Black or African American,Female,"1,177",,Seems to be about analyzing orlooking at the algorithm for facebook posts. And also facebook activity.
TM,2479,10/20,2:01,2:30,Black or African American,Female,749,,"How much facebook monitors what you do. I know like for ads, the cater them to what you click, and I feel  like they do that with people as well. One person came up a lot because I interact with them a lot on FB, so FB shows me the people I interact with a lot. I have friends who ask me if I've seen their posts and I haven't cuz it hadn't shown up. BB is always watching."

TM,3141,10/24,12:03,12:29,Black or African American,Female,349,,"I dont know. I was trying to think about it, I guess that you said its about how accurate the algorythm chooses. but sometimes wha you say isnt what the study is about. I guess i would say what you said since it did seem to be what the study was about."
TM,5363,10/24,1:00,1:33,White,Non-binary,908,,"I think its about how accurate sm algoritms are in showing you content you actually want, and possibly how that relates to advertising and marketing in some way."

TM,6258,10/24,3:00,3:26,Black or African American,Male,"4,950",,"porbably like you said, itsabout judging interactions and how the algorithm relates with my mood, how i react to the post and interact with the posts."

TM,8823,10/27,10:58,11:26,White,Male,"1,178",,Probably seeing how well the FB algorithm generates interaction. Seeing the connection between our algorithm and the stuff we're actually interacting with. You can definitely see that the music groups i interact with for work have influenced what the algorithm chooses to show me.
TM,5481,10/27,12:56,1:22,White,Male,508,,"My use on FB and how posts get shown to me, and what types of posts get shown to me based on the activity I've done. So like you said, the algorithm. It seems i like a lot of wedding photos and baby pics, and so that's what FB shows me."

TM,4409,10/28,2:03,12:40,Asian,Female,495,,"Its about interactions on FB (lol) and I don't know... (took a second to think) Maybe like whether there is a relationship between my activity with real people and whether they are more likely to show up in my feed, and also whether if we have more mutual friends that affects my rating of the post, or that if I interact with posts more often those kinds of posts will show more often. I do feel like that things show up in waves, that like some days a person shows up frequently but others they arent there, even though after I check they are still posting regularly."
TM,8245,10/28,2:55,3:20,Asian,Female,367,,Its about our behaviourt on socila media and how the algorithm interprets our actions on social media.

TM,6787,11/6,3:08,,Hispanic,Male,"1,303",,"Like you said, it about how accurate FB algorithm is. I've been studying about algorithms in school, and how FB has been allegedly listening and tapping into your phone to show you ads, so I think this study specifically is about how well the AI is working at getting you to stay on your phone for as long as possible."
